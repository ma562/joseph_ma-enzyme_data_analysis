					The main focus of this project was to find the best fitting model parameters to represent a data set of reaction velocities and substrate concentrations. In an ideal situation, the data could be perfectly modeled by the michaelis-menten curve shown in the image with the red curve. The equation to model this is shown below the graph. V0 refers to the reaction velocity v. How we obtain V0 from the set of data will be further discussed later. V<sub>max</sub> refers to the maximum reaction velocity or the asymptote at which the red curve approaches. K<sub>m</sub> is the substrate concentration that corresponds to a reaction velocity that is half V<sub>max</sub>. And S is the substrate concentration.
					<br><br>
					In this project, we were given 5 enzymes to analyze: A, B, C, D, E. Each enzyme had a test 1 and an extra test 1 duplicate. We therefore had 10 sets of data in total. Our first step was to obtain the V0 values from each set of data. For each set of data, we were given 10 seperate initial substrate concentrations and we could therefore determine 10 sets of points on the graph (i.e. (S1, V1), (S2, V2)... (S10, V10)). The main challenge in this project was to determine the best V<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>m</sub> parameters in the michaelis-menten equation to represent the 10 sets of points we have found from the data. We combined two fundamental steps in order to solve this problem. The first step involved an algebraic approach while the second step involved using the fundamentals of calculus.

				To simplify the explanation, we will just be focusing on test 1 of Enzyme A (the same process was performed on the Enzymes and tests).<br><br>
				To obtain the 10 sets of points i.e. (S1, V1), (S2, V2)... (S10, V10) from Enzyme A Test 1, we will have to determine the reaction velocities v0 from the data. At the moment, we only have the value of S1, S2 ..., S10 (the substrate concentrations) known that is the values 3.75 uM, 7.5 uM, ..., 2000 uM. The reaction velocities v0 for each substrate concentration can be found as the initial rate of change of the plot of [P](uM) vs Time (s). To find the corresponding reaction velocity v0 for substrate concentration 3.75 uM, a plot is shown of [P](uM)- column B vs Time (s)- column A.<br><br>
				The reaction velocity v0 can be represented by the slope of the tangent line at the initial interval of the plot. Based on our algorithm, we determined that it was most accurate to find the slope of the line between the initial point and the point at the 5% interval.<br><br>
				The plot between [P](uM)- column B vs Time (s)- column A has data recorded up to 1480 seconds. We therefore find the first 5% interval which is from 0 seconds to 74 seconds. The corresponding value of [P] (uM) at time 74 seconds is 1.492 uM and we know that the initial point is (0 seconds, 0 uM). The slope of the tangent line can then be found as (1.492 - 0) / (74 - 0) which yields a reaction velocity v0 of approximately 0.2016 uM / s. We have found our first point (S1, V1) as (3.75 uM, 0.2016 uM / s). The same process is done to find the rest of the points (S2, V2), (S3, V3)...(S10, V10).
				<br><br>
				Because we were given a test 1 and extra test 1 duplicate for each enzyme, we ended up with two computed V0s for each substrate concentration. We decided to average the two V0 values to move forward with our analysis. For example while Enzyme A test 1 yielded an initial point of (3.75 uM, 0.02016 uM / s), Enzyme A test 1 duplicate yielded an initial point of (3.75 uM, 0.02684 uM / s). We would take the average and use the point (3.75 uM, 0.0235 uM / s) in our analysis.
				<br><br>
				The rest of the points for Enzyme A were determined by the same process and are as follows:<br>
				(3.75 uM, 0.0235 uM / s), (7.5 uM, 0.0437 uM / s), (15 uM, 0.0788 uM / s), (30 uM, 0.1552 uM / s), (65 uM, 0.2633 uM / s), (125 uM, 0.3997 uM / s), (250 uM, 0.5553 uM / s), (500 uM, 0.6730 uM / s), (1000 uM, 0.7908 uM / s), (2000 uM, 0.8794 uM / s).
